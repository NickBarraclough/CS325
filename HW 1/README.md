Two sorting algorithms that will take in a properly formatted .txt file of the numbers to be sorted.

mergeSort.py is a python program to read in data from "data.txt" and output a sorted version using merge sort.

insertionSort.py is a python program to read in data from "data.txt" and output a sorted version using insertion sort.

Both programs are run using the command python3.
( $ python3 [filename] )

Both programs will create a file with the sorted data.
