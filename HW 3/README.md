For knapsack.py:
Run program using the following command:
	python3 knapsack.py
If the program hangs, go to line 38 and edit the while loop to be less than
80. I noticed that in some trials, the program would hang at 75 items.

For shopping.py:
Run program using the following command:
	python3 shopping.py
Ensure shopping.txt is in the current directory and follows the correct format.
Results are printed to an output file called results.txt
