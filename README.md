Running the python programs will require a .txt file as the second argument in the command line execution.
Run the nearest neighbor program using this execution:
~$ python3 NN.py [input file] 
Each execution will start the path at a random city, so it may take a few runs before an semi-optimal solution is found.
Output tour length and running time of the program are displayed to the user
Output file "[input file].tour" formatted like this:
[tour distance]
[first city in path]
[second city in path]
[third city in path]
[fourth city in path]
