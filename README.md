# Measureable Student Learning Outcomes:
 At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
 1. Use O, omega, theta and simple recurrences to analyze time time complexity of iterative and recursive
 algorithms.
 2. Prove the correctness of algorithms.
 3. Implement recursive, iterative and heuristic algorithms.
 4. Prove that a problem is NP-complete using reductions.
